## About Me ✨

I'm a dedicated **Backend Developer** with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems.  
I live and breathe **Go** 🐹, but my curiosity often leads me to experiment with **Rust** 🦀, **Python** 🐍, **Node.js** ⚡, and more.  
When I'm not architecting robust backends, I'm crafting hobby projects (think games 🎮) and exploring the frontier of AI 🤖.

## Skills & Technologies 🛠️

- **Backend Development:** Creating resilient, high-performance systems.
- **Go:** Clean and efficient code that scales. 🐹
- **Rust:** Fast, modern, and memory-safe systems. 🦀
- **Python:** Rapid prototyping and scripting. 🐍
- **Node.js:** Building versatile web solutions. ⚡
- **Additional Tools:** Shell scripting, Docker, Nix, etc.
- **Game Development:** Experimenting with Godot and Unity to bring ideas to life. 🎮
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities. 🤖

## Projects 🚀

Here's a glimpse into my journey:

- **Jump2D:** A 2D platform game crafted in Godot.
- **FlightSim:** A 3D Flight simulator created in Unity.
- **infinity-lab:** My NixOS system driving my live and developlment.
- **...and more:** Browse my repositories for additional projects and experiments.
